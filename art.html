    <h1>Passions</h1>

    <div class="parent-flex">
    <p>
      I'm deeply passionate about public service, policy, and creating spaces for inclusive civic engagement. Through internships on political campaigns and leadership roles in organizations like the Civilian Complaint Review Board’s Youth Advisory Council, I’ve worked to ensure equity, transparency, and community accountability. I care deeply about uplifting underrepresented voices and empowering people—especially youth—to advocate for justice. I’m also committed to neurodiversity and believe that educating leaders about neuroinclusion can transform workplaces and communities. Whether I’m recording a public service announcement or engaging with lawmakers at the White House through Running Start, I’m always driven by a desire to make systems more equitable and representative. In addition to my advocacy work, I have a strong appreciation for the arts, which I believe play a crucial role in social change and community building. I actively seek opportunities to integrate artistic expression into my civic engagement efforts, recognizing the power of art to inspire, challenge, and unite individuals toward common goals.
